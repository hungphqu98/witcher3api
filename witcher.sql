This is actually very easy to avoid by simply doing a roll to the side, and you can bring the Cockatrice down to the ground to hit it by either using Aard, the crossbow or just wait for it to get bored of missing you and land on its own (usually takes about 3 swooping attacks). Once it\'s on the ground, however, this is when it is the most dangerous. It will use its talons, wings and feet to strike against its foe, as well as its razor-sharp beak and tail tip. These attacks are fast, fairly long range as melee attacks go, hit hard and will almost always accurately target vital regions on its victim causing Bleeding that will lead to an inevitable death if not careful. A Witcher should always have the swallow potion ready in order to counteract any wounds sustained. While on the ground, if you back away from them even a small amount they will also frequently do a forward leap-strike; it has dangerously long range, does quite a bit of damage, stuns you and their semi-spread wings as they do it can also cause the hit so it is a very wide strike that can be difficult to roll out of range of. On the defense it has options too; after taking a couple of attacks in a combo if you see it cover its head with its wings, stop attacking as this is effectively a Parry that will do reduced damage to them, stagger you and break Quen if you have it on, and they will quickly follow up with a counterattack.
